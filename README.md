# App-Store-Genre-Prediction-Using-Icons
*Work In Progress* - Using Kaggle AppStore data* from the category of strategy games to try to distinguish subcategories (puzzle vs entertainment) based on the app icons. I also wrote a web scraper to pull additional data from the AppStore, which I do not leverage in this project. But I have posted it (scrape_links_and_app_data.py) here because it is thematically related in case anyone would find it useful.
